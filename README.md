Neuro-Symptom Checker.
Neuro-Symptom Checker is a lightweight, command-line Python tool designed to simulate the decision-making logic of a preliminary neurological assessment. This project serves as an early prototype of how computational thinking can assist clinicians in rapidly narrowing down potential neurological conditions based on patient-reported symptoms.

Why I Built This:
As a medical student with a passion for neurosurgery and an emerging interest in computational medicine, I wanted to explore how simple algorithms could emulate early clinical reasoning. 

What It Does:
Upon launch, the user is guided through a series of clinically relevant yes/no questions- headache, visual disturbances, motor weakness, seizures, etc. Based on their responses, the program suggests a possible neurological condition using a basic ruleset derived from common clinical pathways. The current logic supports conditions such as:

Migraine with aura

Epilepsy

Tension-type headache

Suspected stroke

Nonspecific patterns prompting clinical evaluation.

This tool is an elementary prototype intended solely for educational and exploratory purposes. It does not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Users are strongly advised to consult a licensed physician for any health-related concerns. No clinical decisions should be made based on this programâ€™s output.
